<p>Title: WebGL2 Fundamentals<br />Description: Your first WebGL2 lesson starting with the fundamentals<br />TOC: Fundamentals</p>

<p>First things first, these articles are about WebGL2. If you're interested in WebGL 1.0<br /><a href="https://webglfundamentals.org">please go here</a>. Note that WebGL2 is <a href="webgl1-to-webgl2.html">nearly 100% backward<br />compatible with WebGL 1</a>. That said, once you enable<br />WebGL2 you might as well use it as it was meant to be used. These tutorials follow<br />that path.</p>

<p>WebGL is often thought of as a 3D API. People think "I'll use WebGL and <em>magic</em> I'll get cool 3d".<br />In reality WebGL is just a rasterization engine. It draws <a href="webgl-points-lines-triangles.html">points, lines, and triangles</a> based<br />on code you supply. Getting WebGL to do anything else is up to you to provide code to use points, lines,<br />and triangles to accomplish your task.</p>

<p>WebGL runs on the GPU on your computer. As such you need to provide the code that runs on that GPU.<br />You provide that code in the form of pairs of functions. Those 2 functions are called a vertex shader<br />and a fragment shader and they are each written in a very strictly typed C/C++ like language called<br /><a href="webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html">GLSL</a>. (GL Shader Language). Paired together they are called a <em>program</em>.</p>

<p>A vertex shader's job is to compute vertex positions. Based on the positions the function outputs<br />WebGL can then rasterize various kinds of primitives including <a href="webgl-points-lines-triangles.html">points, lines, or triangles</a>.<br />When rasterizing these primitives it calls a second user supplied function called a fragment shader.<br />A fragment shader's job is to compute a color for each pixel of the primitive currently being drawn.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the entire WebGL API is about <a href="resources/webgl-state-diagram.html">setting up state</a> for these pairs of functions to run.<br />For each thing you want to draw you setup a bunch of state then execute a pair of functions by calling<br /><code>gl.drawArrays</code> or <code>gl.drawElements</code> which executes your shaders on the GPU.</p>

<p>Any data you want those functions to have access to must be provided to the GPU. There are 4 ways<br />a shader can receive data.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Attributes, Buffers, and Vertex Arrays</p>

<p>Buffers are arrays of binary data you upload to the GPU. Usually buffers contain<br />things like positions, normals, texture coordinates, vertex colors, etc although<br />you're free to put anything you want in them.</p>

<p>Attributes are used to specify how to<br />pull data out of your buffers and provide them to your vertex shader.<br />For example you might put positions in a buffer as three 32bit floats<br />per position. You would tell a particular attribute which buffer to pull the positions out of, what type<br />of data it should pull out (3 component 32 bit floating point numbers), what offset<br />in the buffer the positions start, and how many bytes to get from one position to the next.</p>

<p>Buffers are not random access. Instead a vertex shaders is executed a specified number<br />of times. Each time it's executed the next value from each specified buffer is pulled<br />out and assigned to an attribute.</p>

<p>The state of attributes, which buffers to use for each one and how to pull out data<br />from those buffers, is collected into a vertex array object (VAO).</p></li>
<li><p>Uniforms</p>

<p>Uniforms are effectively global variables you set before you execute your shader program.</p></li>
<li><p>Textures</p>

<p>Textures are arrays of data you can randomly access in your shader program. The most<br />common thing to put in a texture is image data but textures are just data and can just<br />as easily contain something other than colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Varyings</p>

<p>Varyings are a way for a vertex shader to pass data to a fragment shader. Depending<br />on what is being rendered, points, lines, or triangles, the values set on a varying<br />by a vertex shader will be interpolated while executing the fragment shader.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>WebGL Hello World</h2>

<p>WebGL only cares about 2 things. Clip space coordinates and colors.<br />Your job as a programmer using WebGL is to provide WebGL with those 2 things.<br />You provide your 2 "shaders" to do this. A Vertex shader which provides the<br />clip space coordinates, and a fragment shader that provides the color.</p>

<p>Clip space coordinates always go from -1 to +1 no matter what size your<br />canvas is. Here is a simple WebGL example that shows WebGL in its simplest form.</p>

<p>Let's start with a vertex shader</p>

<pre><code>#version 300 es

// an attribute is an input (in) to a vertex shader.
// It will receive data from a buffer
in vec4 a_position;

// all shaders have a main function
void main() {

  // gl_Position is a special variable a vertex shader
  // is responsible for setting
  gl_Position = a_position;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When executed, if the entire thing was written in JavaScript instead of GLSL<br />you could imagine it would be used like this</p>

<pre><code>// *** PSEUDO CODE!! ***

var positionBuffer = [
  0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0.5, 0, 0,
  0.7, 0, 0, 0,
];
var attributes = {};
var gl_Position;

drawArrays(..., offset, count) {
  var stride = 4;
  var size = 4;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; count; ++i) {
     // copy the next 4 values from positionBuffer to the a_position attribute
     const start = offset + i * stride;
     attributes.a_position = positionBuffer.slice(start, start + size);
     runVertexShader();
     ...
     doSomethingWith_gl_Position();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In reality it's not quite that simple because <code>positionBuffer</code> would need to be converted to binary<br />data (see below) and so the actual computation for getting data out of the buffer<br />would be a little different but hopefully this gives you an idea of how a vertex<br />shader will be executed.</p>

<p>Next we need a fragment shader</p>

<pre><code>#version 300 es

// fragment shaders don't have a default precision so we need
// to pick one. highp is a good default. It means "high precision"
precision highp float;

// we need to declare an output for the fragment shader
out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
  // Just set the output to a constant reddish-purple
  outColor = vec4(1, 0, 0.5, 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Above we declared <code>outColor</code> as our fragment shader's output. We're setting <code>outColor</code> to <code>1, 0, 0.5, 1</code><br />which is 1 for red, 0 for green, 0.5 for blue, 1 for alpha. Colors in WebGL go from 0 to 1.</p>

<p>Now that we have written the 2 shader functions lets get started with WebGL</p>

<p>First we need an HTML canvas element</p>

<pre><code> &lt;canvas id="c"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in JavaScript we can look that up</p>

<pre><code> var canvas = document.querySelector("#c");
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create a WebGL2RenderingContext</p>

<pre><code> var gl = canvas.getContext("webgl2");
 if (!gl) {
    // no webgl2 for you!
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to compile those shaders to put them on the GPU so first we need to get them into strings.<br />You can create your GLSL strings any way you normally create strings in JavaScript. For example by concatenating,<br />by using AJAX to download them, by putting them in non-javascript script tags, or in this case in<br />multiline template strings.</p>

<pre><code>var vertexShaderSource = `#version 300 es

// an attribute is an input (in) to a vertex shader.
// It will receive data from a buffer
in vec4 a_position;

// all shaders have a main function
void main() {

  // gl_Position is a special variable a vertex shader
  // is responsible for setting
  gl_Position = a_position;
}
`;

var fragmentShaderSource = `#version 300 es

// fragment shaders don't have a default precision so we need
// to pick one. highp is a good default. It means "high precision"
precision highp float;

// we need to declare an output for the fragment shader
out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
  // Just set the output to a constant reddish-purple
  outColor = vec4(1, 0, 0.5, 1);
}
`;
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, most 3D engines generate GLSL shaders on the fly using various types of templates, concatenation, etc.<br />For the samples on this site though none of them are complex enough to need to generate GLSL at runtime.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: <code>#version 300 es</code> <strong>MUST BE THE VERY FIRST LINE OF YOUR SHADER</strong>. No comments or<br />blank lines are allowed before it! <code>#version 300 es</code> tells WebGL2 you want to use WebGL2's<br />shader language called GLSL ES 3.00. If you don't put that as the first line the shader<br />language defaults to WebGL 1.0's GLSL ES 1.00 which has many differences and far less features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next we need a function that will create a shader, upload the GLSL source, and compile the shader.<br />Note I haven't written any comments because it should be clear from the names of the functions<br />what is happening.</p>

<pre><code>function createShader(gl, type, source) {
  var shader = gl.createShader(type);
  gl.shaderSource(shader, source);
  gl.compileShader(shader);
  var success = gl.getShaderParameter(shader, gl.COMPILE_STATUS);
  if (success) {
    return shader;
  }

  console.log(gl.getShaderInfoLog(shader));
  gl.deleteShader(shader);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can now call that function to create the 2 shaders</p>

<pre><code>var vertexShader = createShader(gl, gl.VERTEX_SHADER, vertexShaderSource);
var fragmentShader = createShader(gl, gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER, fragmentShaderSource);
</code></pre>

<p>We then need to <em>link</em> those 2 shaders into a <em>program</em></p>

<pre><code>function createProgram(gl, vertexShader, fragmentShader) {
  var program = gl.createProgram();
  gl.attachShader(program, vertexShader);
  gl.attachShader(program, fragmentShader);
  gl.linkProgram(program);
  var success = gl.getProgramParameter(program, gl.LINK_STATUS);
  if (success) {
    return program;
  }

  console.log(gl.getProgramInfoLog(program));
  gl.deleteProgram(program);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And call it</p>

<pre><code>var program = createProgram(gl, vertexShader, fragmentShader);
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we've created a GLSL program on the GPU we need to supply data to it.<br />The majority of the WebGL API is about setting up state to supply data to our GLSL programs.<br />In this case our only input to our GLSL program is <code>a_position</code> which is an attribute.<br />The first thing we should do is look up the location of the attribute for the program<br />we just created</p>

<pre><code>var positionAttributeLocation = gl.getAttribLocation(program, "a_position");
</code></pre>

<p>Looking up attribute locations (and uniform locations) is something you should<br />do during initialization, not in your render loop.</p>

<p>Attributes get their data from buffers so we need to create a buffer</p>

<pre><code>var positionBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
</code></pre>

<p>WebGL lets us manipulate many WebGL resources on global bind points.<br />You can think of bind points as internal global variables inside WebGL.<br />First you bind a resource to a bind point. Then, all other functions<br />refer to the resource through the bind point. So, let's bind the position buffer.</p>

<pre><code>gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can put data in that buffer by referencing it through the bind point</p>

<pre><code>// three 2d points
var positions = [
  0, 0,
  0, 0.5,
  0.7, 0,
];
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(positions), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot going on here. The first thing is we have <code>positions</code> which is a<br />JavaScript array. WebGL on other hand needs strongly typed data so the part<br /><code>new Float32Array(positions)</code> creates a new array of 32bit floating point numbers<br />and copies the values from <code>positions</code>. <code>gl.bufferData</code> then copies that data to<br />the <code>positionBuffer</code> on the GPU. It's using the position buffer because we bound<br />it to the <code>ARRAY_BUFFER</code> bind point above.</p>

<p>The last argument, <code>gl.STATIC_DRAW</code> is a hint to WebGL about how we'll use the data.<br />WebGL can try to use that hint to optimize certain things. <code>gl.STATIC_DRAW</code> tells WebGL<br />we are not likely to change this data much.</p>

<p>Now that we've put data in a buffer we need to tell the attribute how to get data<br />out of it. First we need to create a collection of attribute state called a Vertex Array Object.</p>

<pre><code>var vao = gl.createVertexArray();
</code></pre>

<p>And we need to make that the current vertex array so that all of our attribute settings<br />will apply to that set of attribute state</p>

<pre><code>gl.bindVertexArray(vao);
</code></pre>

<p>Now we finally setup the attributes in the vertex array. First off we need to turn the attribute on.<br />This tells WebGL we want to get data out of a buffer. If we don't turn on the attribute<br />then the attribute will have a constant value.</p>

<pre><code>gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionAttributeLocation);
</code></pre>

<p>Then we need to specify how to pull the data out</p>

<pre><code>var size = 2;          // 2 components per iteration
var type = gl.FLOAT;   // the data is 32bit floats
var normalize = false; // don't normalize the data
var stride = 0;        // 0 = move forward size * sizeof(type) each iteration to get the next position
var offset = 0;        // start at the beginning of the buffer
gl.vertexAttribPointer(
    positionAttributeLocation, size, type, normalize, stride, offset)
</code></pre>

<p>A hidden part of <code>gl.vertexAttribPointer</code> is that it binds the current <code>ARRAY_BUFFER</code><br />to the attribute. In other words now this attribute is bound to<br /><code>positionBuffer</code>. That means we're free to bind something else to the <code>ARRAY_BUFFER</code> bind point.<br />The attribute will continue to use <code>positionBuffer</code>.</p>

<p>Note that from the point of view of our GLSL vertex shader the <code>a_position</code> attribute is a <code>vec4</code></p>

<pre><code>in vec4 a_position;
</code></pre>

<p><code>vec4</code> is a 4 float value. In JavaScript you could think of it something like<br /><code>a_position = {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w: 0}</code>. Above we set <code>size = 2</code>. Attributes<br />default to <code>0, 0, 0, 1</code> so this attribute will get its first 2 values (x and y)<br />from our buffer. The z, and w will be the default 0 and 1 respectively.</p>

<p>Before we draw we should resize the canvas to match its display size. Canvases just like Images have 2 sizes.<br />The number of pixels actually in them and separately the size they are displayed. CSS determines the size<br />the canvas is displayed. <strong>You should always set the size you want a canvas with CSS</strong> since it is far far<br />more flexible than any other method.</p>

<p>To make the number of pixels in the canvas match the size it's displayed<br /><a href="webgl-resizing-the-canvas.html">I'm using a helper function you can read about here</a>.</p>

<p>In nearly all of these samples the canvas size is 400x300 pixels if the sample is run in its own window<br />but stretches to fill the available space if it's inside an iframe like it is on this page.<br />By letting CSS determine the size and then adjusting to match we easily handle both of these cases.</p>

<pre><code>webglUtils.resizeCanvasToDisplaySize(gl.canvas);
</code></pre>

<p>We need to tell WebGL how to convert from the clip space<br />values we'll be setting <code>gl_Position</code> to back into pixels, often called screen space.<br />To do this we call <code>gl.viewport</code> and pass it the current size of the canvas.</p>

<pre><code>gl.viewport(0, 0, gl.canvas.width, gl.canvas.height);
</code></pre>

<p>This tells WebGL the -1 +1 clip space maps to 0 &lt;-&gt; <code>gl.canvas.width</code> for x and 0 &lt;-&gt; <code>gl.canvas.height</code><br />for y.</p>

<p>We clear the canvas. <code>0, 0, 0, 0</code> are red, green, blue, alpha respectively so in this case we're making the canvas transparent.</p>

<pre><code>// Clear the canvas
gl.clearColor(0, 0, 0, 0);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to tell WebGL which shader program to execute.</p>

<pre><code>// Tell it to use our program (pair of shaders)
gl.useProgram(program);
</code></pre>

<p>Then we need to tell it which set of buffers use and how to pull data out of those buffers to<br />supply to the attributes</p>

<pre><code>// Bind the attribute/buffer set we want.
gl.bindVertexArray(vao);
</code></pre>

<p>After all that we can finally ask WebGL to execute our GLSL program.</p>

<pre><code>var primitiveType = gl.TRIANGLES;
var offset = 0;
var count = 3;
gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, offset, count);
</code></pre>

<p>Because the count is 3 this will execute our vertex shader 3 times. The first time <code>a_position.x</code> and <code>a_position.y</code><br />in our vertex shader attribute will be set to the first 2 values from the positionBuffer.<br />The 2nd time <code>a_position.xy</code> will be set to the 2nd two values. The last time it will be<br />set to the last 2 values.</p>

<p>Because we set <code>primitiveType</code> to <code>gl.TRIANGLES</code>, each time our vertex shader is run 3 times<br />WebGL will draw a triangle based on the 3 values we set <code>gl_Position</code> to. No matter what size<br />our canvas is those values are in clip space coordinates that go from -1 to 1 in each direction.</p>

<p>Because our vertex shader is simply copying our positionBuffer values to <code>gl_Position</code> the<br />triangle will be drawn at clip space coordinates</p>

<pre><code>  0, 0,
  0, 0.5,
  0.7, 0,
</code></pre>

<p>Converting from clip space to screen space if the canvas size<br />happened to be 400x300 we'd get something like this</p>

<pre><code> clip space      screen space
   0, 0       -&gt;   200, 150
   0, 0.5     -&gt;   200, 225
 0.7, 0       -&gt;   340, 150
</code></pre>

<p>WebGL will now render that triangle. For every pixel it is about to draw WebGL will call our fragment shader.<br />Our fragment shader just sets <code>outColor</code> to <code>1, 0, 0.5, 1</code>. Since the Canvas is an 8bit<br />per channel canvas that means WebGL is going to write the values <code>[255, 0, 127, 255]</code> into the canvas.</p>

<p>Here's a live version</p>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-fundamentals.html" }}}</p>

<p>In the case above you can see our vertex shader is doing nothing<br />but passing on our position data directly. Since the position data is<br />already in clip space there is no work to do. <em>If you want 3D it's up to you<br />to supply shaders that convert from 3D to clip space because WebGL is only<br />a rasterization API</em>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why does the triangle start in the middle and go to toward the top right.<br />Clip space in <code>x</code> goes from -1 to +1. That means 0 is in the center and positive values will<br />be to the right of that.</p>

<p>As for why it's on the top, in clip space -1 is at the bottom and +1 is at the top. That means<br />0 is in the center and so positive numbers will be above the center.</p>

<p>For 2D stuff you would probably rather work in pixels than clip space so<br />let's change the shader so we can supply the position in pixels and have<br />it convert to clip space for us. Here's the new vertex shader</p>

<pre><code>-  in vec4 a_position;
+  in vec2 a_position;

+  uniform vec2 u_resolution;

  void main() {
+    // convert the position from pixels to 0.0 to 1.0
+    vec2 zeroToOne = a_position / u_resolution;
+
+    // convert from 0-&gt;1 to 0-&gt;2
+    vec2 zeroToTwo = zeroToOne * 2.0;
+
+    // convert from 0-&gt;2 to -1-&gt;+1 (clip space)
+    vec2 clipSpace = zeroToTwo - 1.0;
+
*    gl_Position = vec4(clipSpace, 0, 1);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Some things to notice about the changes. We changed <code>a_position</code> to a <code>vec2</code> since we're<br />only using <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> anyway. A <code>vec2</code> is similar to a <code>vec4</code> but only has <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>Next we added a <code>uniform</code> called <code>u_resolution</code>. To set that we need to look up its location.</p>

<pre><code>var resolutionUniformLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_resolution");
</code></pre>

<p>The rest should be clear from the comments. By setting <code>u_resolution</code> to the resolution<br />of our canvas the shader will now take the positions we put in <code>positionBuffer</code> supplied<br />in pixels coordinates and convert them to clip space.</p>

<p>Now we can change our position values from clip space to pixels. This time we're going to draw a rectangle<br />made from 2 triangles, 3 points each.</p>

<pre><code>var positions = [
*  10, 20,
*  80, 20,
*  10, 30,
*  10, 30,
*  80, 20,
*  80, 30,
];
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array(positions), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
</code></pre>

<p>And after we set which program to use we can set the value for the uniform we created.<br /><code>gl.useProgram</code> is like <code>gl.bindBuffer</code> above in that it sets the current program. After<br />that all the <code>gl.uniformXXX</code> functions set uniforms on the current program.</p>

<pre><code>gl.useProgram(program);

// Pass in the canvas resolution so we can convert from
// pixels to clip space in the shader
gl.uniform2f(resolutionUniformLocation, gl.canvas.width, gl.canvas.height);
</code></pre>

<p>And of course to draw 2 triangles we need to have WebGL call our vertex shader 6 times<br />so we need to change the <code>count</code> to <code>6</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// draw
var primitiveType = gl.TRIANGLES;
var offset = 0;
*var count = 6;
gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, offset, count);
</code></pre>

<p>And here it is</p>

<p>Note: This example and all following examples use <a href="/webgl/resources/webgl-utils.js"><code>webgl-utils.js</code></a><br />which contains functions to compile and link the shaders. No reason to clutter the examples<br />with that <a href="webgl-boilerplate.html">boilerplate</a> code.</p>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-2d-rectangle.html" }}}</p>

<p>Again you might notice the rectangle is near the bottom of that area. WebGL considers positive Y as<br />up and negative Y as down. In clip space the bottom left corner -1,-1. We haven't changed any signs<br />so with our current math 0, 0 becomes the bottom left corner.<br />To get it to be the more traditional top left corner used for 2d graphics APIs<br />we can just flip the clip space y coordinate.</p>

<pre><code>*   gl_Position = vec4(clipSpace * vec2(1, -1), 0, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>And now our rectangle is where we expect it.</p>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-2d-rectangle-top-left.html" }}}</p>

<p>Let's make the code that defines a rectangle into a function so<br />we can call it for different sized rectangles. While we're at it<br />we'll make the color settable.</p>

<p>First we make the fragment shader take a color uniform input.</p>

<pre><code>#version 300 es

precision highp float;

+  uniform vec4 u_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
-  outColor = vec4(1, 0, 0.5, 1);
*  outColor = u_color;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the new code that draws 50 rectangles in random places and random colors.</p>

<pre><code>  var colorLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_color");
  ...

  // draw 50 random rectangles in random colors
  for (var ii = 0; ii &lt; 50; ++ii) {
    // Setup a random rectangle
    setRectangle(
        gl, randomInt(300), randomInt(300), randomInt(300), randomInt(300));

    // Set a random color.
    gl.uniform4f(colorLocation, Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random(), 1);

    // Draw the rectangle.
    var primitiveType = gl.TRIANGLES;
    var offset = 0;
    var count = 6;
    gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, offset, count);
  }
}

// Returns a random integer from 0 to range - 1.
function randomInt(range) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * range);
}

// Fills the buffer with the values that define a rectangle.

function setRectangle(gl, x, y, width, height) {
  var x1 = x;
  var x2 = x + width;
  var y1 = y;
  var y2 = y + height;

  // NOTE: gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, ...) will affect
  // whatever buffer is bound to the `ARRAY_BUFFER` bind point
  // but so far we only have one buffer. If we had more than one
  // buffer we'd want to bind that buffer to `ARRAY_BUFFER` first.

  gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([
     x1, y1,
     x2, y1,
     x1, y2,
     x1, y2,
     x2, y1,
     x2, y2]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the rectangles.</p>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-2d-rectangles.html" }}}</p>

<p>I hope you can see that WebGL is actually a pretty simple API.<br />Okay, simple might be the wrong word. What it does is simple. It just<br />executes 2 user supplied functions, a vertex shader and fragment shader and<br />draws triangles, lines, or points.<br />While it can get more complicated to do 3D that complication is<br />added by you, the programmer, in the form of more complex shaders.<br />The WebGL API itself is just a rasterizer and conceptually fairly simple.</p>

<p>We covered a small example that showed how to supply data in an attribute and 2 uniforms.<br />It's common to have multiple attributes and many uniforms. Near the top of this article<br />we also mentioned <em>varyings</em> and <em>textures</em>. Those will show up in subsequent lessons.</p>

<p>Before we move on I want to mention that for <em>most</em> applications updating<br />the data in a buffer like we did in <code>setRectangle</code> is not common. I used that<br />example because I thought it was easiest to explain since it shows pixel coordinates<br />as input and demonstrates doing a small amount of math in GLSL. It's not wrong, there<br />are plenty of cases where it's the right thing to do, but you should <a href="webgl-2d-translation.html">keep reading to find out<br />the more common way to position, orient and scale things in WebGL</a>.</p>

<p>If you're 100% new to WebGL and have no idea what GLSL is or shaders or what the GPU does<br />then checkout <a href="webgl-how-it-works.html">the basics of how WebGL really works</a>.<br />You might also want to take a look at this<br /><a href="/webgl/lessons/resources/webgl-state-diagram.html">interactive state diagram</a><br />for another way of understanding how WebGL works.</p>

<p>You should also, at least briefly read about <a href="webgl-boilerplate.html">the boilerplate code used here</a><br />that is used in most of the examples. You should also at least skim<br /><a href="webgl-drawing-multiple-things.html">how to draw multiple things</a> to give you some idea<br />of how more typical WebGL apps are structured because unfortunately nearly all the examples<br />only draw one thing and so do not show that structure.</p>

<p>Otherwise from here you can go in 2 directions. If you are interested in image processing<br />I'll show you <a href="webgl-image-processing.html">how to do some 2D image processing</a>.<br />If you are interesting in learning about translation,<br />rotation and scale then <a href="webgl-2d-translation.html">start here</a>.</p>
