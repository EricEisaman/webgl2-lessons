<p>Title: WebGL2 Indexed Vertices<br />Description: How to use gl.drawElements<br />TOC: Indexed Vertices (gl.drawElements)</p>

<p>This article assumes you've at least read<br /><a href="webgl-fundamentals.html">the article on fundamentals</a>. If<br />you have not read that yet you should probably start there.</p>

<p>This is a short article to cover <code>gl.drawElements</code>. There are 2<br />basic drawing functions in WebGL. <code>gl.drawArrays</code> and <code>gl.drawElements</code>.<br />Most of the articles on the site that explicitly call one or the other<br />call <code>gl.drawArrays</code> as it's the most straight forward.</p>

<p><code>gl.drawElements</code> on the other hand uses a buffer filled with<br />vertex indices and draws based on that.</p>

<p>Let's take the example that draws rectangles from<br /><a href="webgl-fundamentals.html">the first article</a> and make it use<br /><code>gl.drawElements</code></p>

<p>In that code we created a rectangle from 2 triangles, 3 vertices<br />each for a total of 6 vertices. </p>

<p>Here was our code that provided 6 vertex positions</p>

<pre><code>
  var x1 = x;
  var x2 = x + width;
  var y1 = y;
  var y2 = y + height;
  gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([
     x1, y1,   // vertex 0
     x2, y1,   // vertex 1
     x1, y2,   // vertex 2
     x1, y2,   // vertex 3
     x2, y1,   // vertex 4
     x2, y2,   // vertex 5
  ]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
</code></pre>

<p>We can instead use data for 4 vertices</p>

<pre><code>
  var x1 = x;
  var x2 = x + width;
  var y1 = y;
  var y2 = y + height;
  gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, new Float32Array([
     x1, y1,  // vertex 0
     x2, y1,  // vertex 1
     x1, y2,  // vertex 2
     x2, y2,  // vertex 3
  ]), gl.STATIC_DRAW);
</code></pre>

<p>But, then we need to add another buffer with indices because WebGL still<br />requires that to draw 2 triangles we must tell it to draw 6 vertices in total.</p>

<p>To do this we create another buffer but we use a different binding point.<br />Instead of the <code>ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point we use the <code>ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code><br />binding point which is always used for indices.</p>

<pre><code>
// create the buffer
const indexBuffer = gl.createBuffer();

// make this buffer the current 'ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER'
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexBuffer);

// Fill the current element array buffer with data
const indices = [
  0, 1, 2,   // first triangle
  2, 1, 3,   // second triangle
];
gl.bufferData(
    gl.ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER,
    new Uint16Array(indices),
    gl.STATIC_DRAW
);
</code></pre>

<p>Like all data in WebGL we need a specific representation for the <br />indices. We convert the indices to unsigned 16 bit integers with<br /><code>new Uint16Array(indices)</code> and then upload them to the buffer.</p>

<p>It's important to note that unlike the <code>ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point<br />which is global state, the <code>ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point is<br />part of the current vertex array. </p>

<p>In the code we created and bound a vertex array and then setup<br />the index buffer. That means, like the attributes, anytime we<br />bind this vertex array the index buffer will be also be bound.<br />See <a href="webgl-attributes.html">the article on attributes</a> for more info.</p>

<p>At draw time we call <code>drawElements</code></p>

<pre><code>
// Draw the rectangle.
var primitiveType = gl.TRIANGLES;
var offset = 0;
var count = 6;
-gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, offset, count);
+var indexType = gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT;
+gl.drawElements(primitiveType, count, indexType, offset);
</code></pre>

<p>We get the same results as before but we only had to supply data for 4<br />vertices instead of 6. We still had to ask WebGL to draw 6 vertices but this let<br />us reuse data for 4 vertices through the indices.</p>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-2d-rectangles-indexed.html"}}}</p>

<p>Whether you use indexed or non indexed data is up to you.</p>

<p>It's important to note that indexed vertices won't usually let you make a cube<br />with 8 vertex positions because generally you want to associate other data with<br />each vertex, data that is different depending on which face that vertex position <br />is being used with. For example if you wanted to give each face of the cube a different<br />color you'd need to provide that color with the position. So even though the<br />same position is used 3 times, once for each face a vertex touches, you'd still<br />need to repeat the position, once for each different face, each with a different<br />associated color. That would mean you'd need 24 vertices for a cube, 4 for each<br />side and then 36 indices to draw the required 12 triangles.</p>

<p>Valid types for <code>indexType</code> above are <code>gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE</code><br />where you can only have indices from 0 to 255, in which case you'd use <code>new Uint8Array(indices)</code>,<br /><code>gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT</code> where the maximum index is 65535 which we used above, <br />and <code>gl.UNSIGNED_INT</code> which has a maximum index of 4294967296 and where you'd use<br /><code>new Uint32Array(indices)</code>.</p>
