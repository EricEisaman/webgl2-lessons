<p>Title: WebGL - Cross Origin Images<br />Description: Using images across domains<br />TOC: Cross Origin Images</p>

<p>This article is one in a series of articles about WebGL. If you haven't read<br />them I suggest you <a href="webgl-fundamentals.html">start with an earlier lesson</a>.</p>

<p>In WebGL it's common to download images and then upload them to the GPU to be<br />used as textures. There's been several samples here that do this. For<br />example the article about <a href="webgl-image-processing.html">image processing</a>, the<br />article about <a href="webgl-3d-textures.html">textures</a> and the article about<br /><a href="webgl-2d-drawimage.html">implementing 2d drawImage</a>.</p>

<p>Typically we download an image something like this</p>

<pre><code>// creates a texture info { width: w, height: h, texture: tex }
// The texture will start with 1x1 pixels and be updated
// when the image has loaded
function loadImageAndCreateTextureInfo(url) {
  var tex = gl.createTexture();
  gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, tex);
  // Fill the texture with a 1x1 blue pixel.
  gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, 1, 1, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE,
                new Uint8Array([0, 0, 255, 255]));

  gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_S, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
  gl.texParameteri(gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_T, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);

  var textureInfo = {
    width: 1,   // we don't know the size until it loads
    height: 1,
    texture: tex,
  };
  var img = new Image();
  img.addEventListener('load', function() {
    textureInfo.width = img.width;
    textureInfo.height = img.height;

    gl.bindTexture(gl.TEXTURE_2D, textureInfo.texture);
    gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, img);
    gl.generateMipmap(gl.TEXTURE_2D);
  });
  img.src = url;

  return textureInfo;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is images might have private data in them (for example a captcha, a signature, a naked picture, ...).<br />A webpage often has ads and other things not in direct control of the page and so the browser needs to prevent<br />those things from looking at the contents of these private images.</p>

<p>Just using <code>&lt;img src="private.jpg"&gt;</code> is not a problem because although the image will get displayed by<br />the browser a script can not see the data inside the image. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D">The Canvas2D API</a><br />has a way to see inside the image. First you draw the image into the canvas</p>

<pre><code>ctx.drawImage(someImg, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you get the data</p>

<pre><code>var data = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, width, heigh);
</code></pre>

<p>But, if the image you drew came from a different domain the browser will mark the canvas as <em>tainted</em> and<br />you'll get a security error when you call <code>ctx.getImageData</code></p>

<p>WebGL has to take it even one step further. In WebGL <code>gl.readPixels</code> is the equivalent call to <code>ctx.getImageData</code><br />so you'd think maybe just blocking that would be enough but it turns out even if you can't read the pixels<br />directly you can make shaders that take longer to run based on the colors in the image. Using that information<br />you can use timing to effectively look inside the image indirectly and find out its contents.</p>

<p>So, WebGL just bans all images that are not from the same domain. For example here's a short sample<br />that draws a rotating rectangle with a texture from another domain.<br />Notice the texture never loads and we get an error</p>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-cors-permission-bad.html" }}}</p>

<p>How do we work around this?</p>

<h2>Enter CORS</h2>

<p>CORS = Cross Origin Resource Sharing. It's a way for the webpage to ask the image server for permission<br />to use the image.</p>

<p>To do this we set the <code>crossOrigin</code> attribute to something and then when the browser tries to get the<br />image from the server, if it's not the same domain, the browser will ask for CORS permission.</p>

<pre><code>...
+    img.crossOrigin = "";   // ask for CORS permission
    img.src = url;
</code></pre>

<p>The string you set <code>crossOrigin</code> to is sent to the server. The server can look at that string and decide<br />whether or not to give you permission. Most servers that support CORS don't look at the string, they just<br />give permission to everyone. This is why setting it to the empty string works. All it means in this case<br />is "ask permission" vs say <code>img.crossOrigin = "bob"</code> would mean "ask permission for 'bob'.</p>

<p>Why don't we just always see that permission? Because asking for permission takes 2 HTTP requests so it's<br />slower than not asking. If we know we're on the same domain or we know we won't use the image for anything<br />except img tags and or canvas2d then we don't want to set <code>crossOrigin</code> because it<br />will make things slower.</p>

<p>We can make a function that checks if the image we're trying to load is on the same origin and if<br />so sets the <code>crossOrigin</code> attribute.</p>

<pre><code>function requestCORSIfNotSameOrigin(img, url) {
  if ((new URL(url, window.location.href)).origin !== window.location.origin) {
    img.crossOrigin = "";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And we can use it like this</p>

<pre><code>...
+requestCORSIfNotSameOrigin(img, url);
img.src = url;
</code></pre>

<p>{{{example url="../webgl-cors-permission-good.html" }}}</p>

<p>It's important to note asking for permission does NOT mean you'll be granted permission.<br />That is up to the server. Github pages give permission, flickr.com gives permission,<br />imgur.com gives permission, but most websites do not.</p>

<h3>Making Apache grant CORS permission</h3>
<p>If you're running a website with apache and you have the mod_rewrite plugin installed
you can grant blanket CORS support by putting</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</pre>
<p>
In the appropriate <code>.htaccess</code> file.
