<p>Title: WebGL Cross Platform Issues<br />Description: Things to be aware of when trying to make your WebGL app work everywhere.<br />TOC: Cross Platform Issues</p>

<p>I probably comes as no shock that not all WebGL programs work on all devices or<br />browser. For one WebGL2, at least as of July 2020, <a href="#safari">is not supported at all in<br />Safari</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a list of most of the issues you might run into off the top of my head</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>A top end GPU probably runs 100x faster than a low-end GPU. The only way around<br />that that I know of is to either aim low, or else give the user options like<br />most Desktop PC apps do where they can choose performance or fidelity.</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>Similarly a top end GPU might have 12 to 24 gig of ram where as a low end GPU<br />probably has less than 1gig. (I'm old so it's amazing to me low end = 1gig since<br />I started programming on machines with 16k to 64k of memory ðŸ˜œ)</p>

<h2>Device Limits</h2>

<p>WebGL has various minimum supported features but your local device might support</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>than that minimum which means it will fail on other devices that support less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The max texture size allowed</p>

<p>2048 or 4096 seems to be reasonable limits. At least as of 2020 it looks like<br /><a href="https://webglstats.com/webgl/parameter/MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE">99% of devices support 4096 but only 50% support > 4096</a>.</p>

<p>Note: the max texture size is the maximum dimension the GPU can process. It<br />doesn't mean that GPU has enough memory for that dimension squared (for a 2D<br />texture) or cubed (for a 3D texture). For example some GPUs have a max size of</p>

<ol><li>But a 3D texture 16384 on each side would require 16 terabytes of
memory!!!</li></ol></li>
<li><p>The maximum number of vertex attributes in a single program</p>

<p>In WebGL1 the minimum supported is 8. In WebGL2 it's 16. If you're using more than that<br />then your code will fail on a machine with only the minimum</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum number of uniform vectors</p>

<p>These are specified separately for vertex shaders and fragment shaders.</p>

<p>In WebGL1 it's 128 for vertex shaders and 16 for fragment shaders<br />In WebGL2 it's 256 for vertex shaders and 224 for fragment shaders</p>

<p>Note that uniforms can be "packed" so the number above is how many <code>vec4</code>s<br />can be used. Theoretically you could have 4x the number of <code>float</code> uniforms.<br />but there is an algorithm that fits them in. You can imagine the space as<br />an array with 4 columns, one row for each of the maximum uniform vectors above.</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre lang=""> +-+-+-+-+<br /> | | | | |   &lt;- one vec4<br /> | | | | |   |<br /> | | | | |   |<br /> | | | | |   V<br /> | | | | |   max uniform vectors rows<br /> | | | | |<br /> | | | | | <br /><br /> | | | | |<br /> ...</p>

<p></pre></div></p>

<p>First <code>vec4</code>s are allocated with a <code>mat4</code> being 4 <code>vec4</code>s. Then <code>vec3</code>s are<br />fit in the space left. Then <code>vec2</code>s followed by <code>float</code>s. So imagine we had 1<br /><code>mat4</code>, 2 <code>vec3</code>s, 2 <code>vec2</code>s and 3 <code>float</code>s</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre lang=""> +-+-+-+-+<br /> |m|m|m|m|   &lt;- the mat4 takes 4 rows<br /> |m|m|m|m|<br /> |m|m|m|m|<br /> |m|m|m|m|<br /> |3|3|3| |   &lt;- the 2 vec3s take 2 rows<br /> |3|3|3| |<br /> |2|2|2|2|   &lt;- the 2 vec2s can squeeze into 1 row <br /> |f|f|f| |   &lt;- the 3 floats fit in one row<br /> ...</p>

<p></pre></div></p>

<p>Further, an array of uniforms is always vertical so for example if the maximum<br />allowed uniform vectors is 16 then you can not have a 17 element <code>float</code> array<br />and in fact if you had a single <code>vec4</code> that would take an entire row so there<br />are only 15 rows left meaning the largest array you can have would be 15<br />elements.</p>

<p>My advice though is don't count on perfect packing. Although the spec says the<br />algorithm above is required to pass there are too many combinations to test<br />that all drivers pass. Just be aware if you're getting close the limit.</p>

<p>note: varyings and attributes can not be packed.</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum varying vectors.</p>

<p>WebGL1 the minimum is 8. WebGL2 it's 16.</p>

<p>If you use more than your code will not work on a machine with only the minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum texture units</p>

<p>There are 3 values here.</p>

<ol><li>How many texture units there are</li>
<li>How many texture units a vertex shader can reference</li>
<li>How many texture units a fragment shader can reference</li></ol>

<table class="tabular-data">
<thead>
  <tr><th></th><th>WebGL1</th><th>WebGL2</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td>min texture units that exist</td><td>8</td><td>32</td></tr>
  <tr><td>min texture units a vertex shader can reference</td><th style="color: red;">0!</td><td>16</td></tr>
  <tr><td>min texture units a fragment shader can reference</td><td>8</td><td>16</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>It's important to note the <strong>0</strong> for a vertex shader in WebGL1. Note that that's probably not the end of the world.<br />Apparently <a href="https://webglstats.com/webgl/parameter/MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS">~97% of all devices support at least 4</a>.<br />Still, you might want to check so you can either tell the user that your app is not going to work for them or<br />you can fallback to some other shaders.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are other limits as well. To look them up you call <code>gl.getParameter</code> with<br />the following values. </p>

<div class="webgl_center">
<table class="tabular-data">
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE                </td><td>max size of a texture</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS              </td><td>num attribs you can have</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_VERTEX_UNIFORM_VECTORS      </td><td>num vec4 uniforms a vertex shader can have</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_VARYING_VECTORS             </td><td>num varyings you have</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS</td><td>num texture units that exist</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_VERTEX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS  </td><td>num texture units a vertex shader can reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS         </td><td>num texture units a fragment shader can reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_VECTORS    </td><td>num vec4 uniforms a fragment shader can have</td></tr>
    <tr><td>MAX_CUBE_MAP_TEXTURE_SIZE       </td><td>max size of a cubemap</td></tr>

    <tr><td>MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS               </td><td>max size of the viewport</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>That is not the entire list. For example the max point size and max line thickness<br />but you should basically assume the max line thickness is 1.0 and that POINTS<br />are only useful for simple demos where you don't care about<br /><a href="#points-lines-viewport-scissor-behavior">the clipping issues</a>.</p>

<p>WebGL2 adds several more. A few common ones are</p>

<h2>Depth Buffer resolution</h2>

<p>A few really old mobile devices use 16bit depth buffers. Otherwise, AFAICT 99%<br />of devices use a 24bit depth buffer so you probably don't have to worry about<br />this.</p>

<h2>readPixels format/type combos</h2>

<p>Only certain format/type combos are guaranteed to work. Other combos are<br />optional. This is covered in <a href="webgl-readpixels.html">this article</a>.</p>

<h2>framebuffer attachment combos</h2>

<p>Framebuffers can have 1 or more attachments of textures and renderbuffers.</p>

<p>In WebGL1 only 3 combinations of attachments are guaranteed to work.</p>

<ol>
<li>a single format = <code>RGBA</code>, type= = <code>UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> texture as <code>COLOR_ATTACHMENT0</code></li>
<li>a format = <code>RGBA</code>, type= = <code>UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> texture as <code>COLOR_ATTACHMENT0</code> and a
format = <code>DEPTH_COMPONENT</code> renderbuffer attached as <code>DEPTH_ATTACHMENT</code></li>
<li>a format = <code>RGBA</code>, type= = <code>UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> texture as <code>COLOR_ATTACHMENT0</code> and a
format = <code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code> renderbuffer attached as <code>DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT</code></li>
</ol>

<p>All other combinations are up to the implementation which you check by calling<br /><code>gl.checkFramebufferStatus</code> and seeing if it returned <code>FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE</code>.</p>

<p>WebGL2 guarantees to be able to write to many more formats but still has the<br />limit in that <strong>any combination can fail!</strong> Your best bet might be if all the<br />color attachments are the same format if you attach more than 1.</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p>Many features of WebGL1 and WebGL2 are optional. The entire point of having an<br />API called <code>getExtension</code> is that it can fail if the extension does not exist<br />and so you should be checking for that failure and not blindly assuming it will<br />succeed.</p>

<p>Probably the most common missing extension on WebGL1 and WebGL2 is<br /><code>OES_texture_float_linear</code> which is the ability to filter a floating point<br />texture, meaning the ability to support setting <code>TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER</code> and<br /><code>TEXTURE_MAX_FILTER</code> to anything except <code>NEAREST</code>. Many mobile devices do not<br />support this.</p>

<p>In WebGL1 another often missing extension is <code>WEBGL_draw_buffers</code> which is the<br />ability to attach more than 1 color attachment to a framebuffer is still at<br />around 70% for desktop and almost none for smartphones (that seems wrong).<br />Basically any device that can run WebGL2 should also support<br /><code>WEBGL_draw_buffers</code> in WebGL1 but still, it's apparently still an issue. If you<br />are needing to render to multiple textures at once it's likely your page needs a<br />high end GPU period. Still, you should check if the user device supports it and<br />if not provide a friendly explanation.</p>

<p>For WebGL1 the following 3 extensions seem almost universally supported so while<br />you might want to warn the user your page is not going to work if they are<br />missing it's likely that user has an extremely old device that wasn't going to<br />run your page well anyway.</p>

<p>They are, <code>ANGLE_instance_arrays</code> (the ability to use <a href="webgl-instanced-drawing.html">instanced drawing</a>),<br /><code>OES_vertex_array_object</code> (the ability to store all the attribute state in an object so you can swap all<br />that state with a single function call. See <a href="webgl-attributes.html">this</a>), and <code>OES_element_index_uint</code><br />(the ability to use <code>UNSIGNED_INT</code> 32 bit indices with <a href="webgl-indexed-vertices.html"><code>drawElements</code></a>).</p>

<h2>attribute locations</h2>

<p>A semi common bug is not looking up attribute locations. For example you have a vertex shader like</p>

<pre><code>
attribute vec4 position;
attribute vec2 texcoord;

uniform mat4 matrix;

varying vec2 v_texcoord;

void main() {
   gl_Position = matrix * position;
   v_texcoord = texcoord;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your code assumes that <code>position</code> will be attribute 0 and <code>texcoord</code> will be<br />attribute 1 but that is not guaranteed. So it runs for you but fails for someone<br />else. Often this can be a bug in that you didn't do this intentionally but<br />through an error in the code things work when the locations are one way but not<br />another.</p>

<p>There are 3 solutions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Always look up the locations.</li>
<li>Assign locations by calling <code>gl.bindAttribLocation</code> before calling <code>gl.linkProgram</code></li>
<li><p>WebGL2 only, set the locations in the shader as in</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre lang="glsl">

<h1>version 300 es</h1>

layout(location = 0) vec4 position;
latout(location = 1) vec2 texcoord;
...
</pre></div>

<p>Solution 2 seems the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">D.R.Y.</a> where as solution 3<br />seems the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself#DRY_vs_WET_solutions">W.E.T.</a> unless<br />you're generating your textures at runtime.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>GLSL undefined behavior</h2>

<p>Several GLSL functions have undefined behavior. For example <code>pow(x, y)</code> is<br />undefined if <code>x &lt; 0</code>. There is a longer list at <a href="webgl-3d-lighting-spot.html">the bottom of the article on<br />spot lighting</a>.</p>

<h2>Shader precision issues</h2>

<p>In 2020 the biggest issue here is if you use <code>mediump</code> or <code>lowp</code> in your shaders<br />then on desktop the GPU will really use <code>highp</code> but on mobile they'll actually be<br /><code>mediump</code> and or <code>lowp</code> and so you won't notice any issues when developing on desktop.</p>

<p>See <a href="webgl-precision-issues.html">this article for more details</a>.</p>

<h2>Points, Lines, Viewport, Scissor behavior</h2>

<p><code>POINTS</code> and <code>LINES</code> in WebGL can have a max size of 1 and in fact for <code>LINES</code><br />that is now the most common limit. Further whether points are clipped when their<br />center is outside the viewport is implementation defined. See the bottom of<br /><a href="webgl-drawing-without-data.html#pointissues">this article</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, whether or not the viewport clips vertices only or also pixels is<br />undefined. The scissor always clips pixels so turn on the scissor test and set<br />the scissor size if you set the viewport smaller than the thing you're drawing<br />to and you're drawing LINES or POINTS.</p>

<h2>Safari Bugs</h2>

<p>Safari has more WebGL bugs than any other modern browser and Apple seems to<br />have zero interest in fixing any of them.</p>

<p>Here's a short list of some bugs unfixed for years</p>

<ul>
<li><p>toDataURL (and just guessing toBlob) returns upside down result if premultipliedAlpha = false (4yrs old)<br /><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156129">bug</a></p></li>

<li><p><a id="safari"></a>Also note that while there is an option to enable WebGL2 in Safari<br />all it does is allow <code>#version 300 es</code> shaders. All other 80+ WebGL2<br />api functions are unimplemented, at least as of July 2020.<br /><a href="https://trac.webkit.org/browser/webkit/trunk/Source/WebCore/html/canvas/WebGL2RenderingContext.cpp">See the source</a><br />and search for "not implemented".</p></li>
